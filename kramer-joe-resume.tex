		{\emph{01/2011 -- 09/2012, 03/2014 -- 06/2018}}
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Developed software for a highly fault-tolerant robotics system.
		\item Designed and implemented the resource manager for multiple robots sharing a single rack and pinion gear track.
		\item Worked on a multitude of failure recovery scenarios to ensure maximum uptime.
		\item Programmed primarily in \CPP \ on an embedded Linux platform. Also programmed in Java for the simulation environment and Ruby and Javascript for a web application.
		\item Team used Agile Scrum development methodology including extensive unit testing, code reviews, and CI to rapidly ship quality software.
		\item Wrote a physical simulation environment for integration testing of the robotics system.
        \item Worked with a team to design and implement a new web interface to the tape library. The front end was a backbone.js based single page application backed by a Ruby on Rails app server and a Postgresql database.

	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Traveled to customer sites to perform installations and provide on site support in the early stages of the product launch.
        \item Our customers ran some of the largest data centers in the world including The Genome Project, Bluewaters supercomputer, NASA, LLNL, Argon National Labs, and SBS and KMA TV stations in Seoul, Korea.
		\item Solved technical problems and managed customer expectations in high pressure situations.
		\item Wrote software part time on tools for sending SCSI commands and updating firmware on various library components.

		{\emph{11/2012 -- 02/2014}}
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item First engineering hire at a startup. The company sold a system where people can listen to muted televisions with their phones in places like sports bars, health clubs, and casinos. The company raised over \$4m in funding.
		\item Programmed firmware for boards to digitize audio and transmit it over WiFi networks. Also tuned WiFi access points to optimize for streaming audio traffic and minimize latency.
		\item Streamlined the site survey and installation process.
        \item Wrote software for a LAMP server that showed locations where the product was available and what was playing on the televisions in each location.
        \item Developed Android and iOS apps to connect to Audioair networks, select channels, and receive audio in real time.
        \item Interfaced with a hardware design firm to specify an audio digitizer and transmitter box.

		{\emph{05/2009 -- 12/2010}}
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Worked on proof of concept project with IBM to manage encryption keys for enterprise SAN networks.
		\item Encryption was done in hardware on Host Bus Adapters made by Emulex. I worked on mid and low level SCSI drivers to handle encryption keys. The low level driver is included in the Linux kernel.
		\item Developed the packaging and deployment of software to support encrypting HBAs. Supported rpm packages for Red Hat Linux and a Windows install wizard.
